    Project: "Robotic Arm",
    Description:
      "A robotic arm is a type of mechanical arm, usually programmable, with similar functions to a human arm; the arm may be the sum total of the mechanism or may be part of a more complex robot. The links of such a manipulator are connected by joints allowing either rotational motion (such as in an articulated robot) or translational (linear) displacement. The terminus of the kinematic chain of the manipulator is called the end effectors and it is analogous to the human hand. The end effectors, or robotic hand, can be designed to perform any desired task such as welding, gripping, spinning etc., depending on the application",

    Project: "Cylindrical manipulator",
    Description:
      "Cylindrical manipulator robots are designed for a specialized cylindrical workspace, offering dynamic linear and rotational movements. With vertical and radial axes, they can navigate obstacles, making them ideal for confined spaces. These robots are cost-effective and commonly used in assembly and packaging for tasks like loading/unloading machines. Integration with OpenCV enhances their capabilities, enabling real-time perception and autonomy for tasks like object recognition and manipulation. This makes them well-suited for automation in complex environments. ",

This autonomous marvel gracefully follows lines on the ground, discerning dark lines on light surfaces or light lines on dark surfaces. Beyond its line-following prowess, the robot seamlessly integrates maze-solving algorithms into its repertoire. It efficiently navigates through mazes in a single run, utilizing intelligent algorithms to read the maze layout. Upon reaching the maze's end, it not only accomplishes the journey but also intelligently returns, optimizing its path for the shortest route.",
